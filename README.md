# Face Recognition and Features Extractor
The idea of this project is to detect faces from a source, recognize the person and extract some possible features, like: Age, Ethnicity, Sex, etc.

So the project is segmented in three parts.

## 1 - Face Detection
- Use a pre-trained model (YOLOV8 for real time detection)
- Fine tune the model for face detection only
- Use a software to prepare the dataset for the training (RoboFlow)

## 2 - Face Recognition
- Use a pre-trained model (MobileNetV3 or other)
- Fine tune the model for face recognition
- Use a software to prepare the dataset for the training (RoboFlow)

## 3 - Features Extractor
- TBD
